This repository is the code for the web interface of my first Data Engineering project
(GDELT-education).
I had to make a separate repository b/c this code is refactored from the original
code I wrote for a Flask web interface that utilized the seaborn library, whereas
for the website I'm using to host this website (pythonanwhere), importing the library
took up too much space.
The actual code used to create the flask app is here:
https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/yohndezmon/files/home/yohndezmon/flask-no-seaborn
but I wanted to keep a git repository to keep versions of the code that I'm using there.
Anything that I change here must also be changed in the pythonanywhere repository located
at the link above.
